    Ecological Metadata Language (EML) is a metadata specification developed
    by the ecology discipline and for the ecology discipline.  It is based
    on prior work done by the Ecological Society of America and associated
    efforts (Michener et al., 1997, Ecological Applications).
    EML is implemented as a series of XML document types that can
    by used in a modular and extensible manner to document ecological data.
    Each EML module is designed to describe one logical part of the total
    metadata that should be included with any ecological dataset.

  <td>
  <p>
  The EML project is an open source, community oriented project
  dedicated to providing a high-quality metadata specification
  for describing data relevant to the ecological discipline.
  The project is completely comprised of
  <a href="members.html">voluntary project members</a> who donate
  their time and experience in order to advance
  information management for ecology. Project decisions are made by
  consensus according to the voting procedures described in the <a
  href="http://www.ecoinformatics.org/charter.html">ecoinformatics.org
  Charter</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  We welcome contributions to this work in any form.  Individuals
  who invest substantial amounts of time and make valuable
  contributions to the development and maintenance of EML (in the
  opinion of current project members) will be invited to become
  EML project members according to the rules set forth in the <a
  href="http://www.ecoinformatics.org/charter.html">ecoinformatics.org
  Charter</a>. Contributions can take many forms, including the
  development of the EML schemas, writing documentation, and helping
  with maintenance, among others.
