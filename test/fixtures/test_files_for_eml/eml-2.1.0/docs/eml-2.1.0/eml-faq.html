        developed by the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) is a
        monolithic standard, and so it is difficult to mix and match parts of
        it with other standards -- mainly because of all of the spatial
        requirements. So, we built EML as a series of modules that can be
        linked together and can be linked to other metadata standards. This
        gives us the most flexibility, and given that we can easily translate
        into CSDGM compliant documents, there is little cost. Second, we're
        building advanced data processing tools that can automatically parse
        data sets and analyze them based on the EML metadata descriptions. Due
        to various shortcomings in the FGDC standard, mostly oriented around
        its tight focus on spatial data, we have found that the CSDGM isn't
        adequate for these needs, e.g., how can one add machine parsable,
        semantically oriented attribute tags to CSDGM? Answer, you can't,
        because it is monolithic and doesn't permit dynamic ties to other
        metadata specs -- the only extension method is via the administrative
        challenge of creating a superset of the CSDGM -- not very maintainable.
        In addition, the level of granularity for metadata in FGDC is very
        patchy -- it goes into great detail for spatial projections, etc., but
        is incredibly terse with respect to describing methods and non-standard
        data formats. This is appropriate in the spatial world where there are
        few data formats (&lt; 100, many sensor derived streams), but not so
        good in ecology where there is no standardization of data formats
        (&gt;&gt;&gt;5000, very few sensor derived).</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td valign="top" align="left"><a name="id.4"></a><a name="N10033"></a><b>4. </b></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Is there documentation for EML in English?</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td valign="top" align="left"><b></b></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Yes, there is a <a href="index.html" target="_top">formal

        ecological and environmental data, catalyzed by societal concerns and
        facilitated by advancing technologies. These data have the potential to
        greatly enhance understanding of the complexity of the biosphere.
        However, broad-scale or synthetic research is stymied because data are
        largely unorganized and inaccessible as a consequence of their
        tremendous heterogeneity, complexity, and spatial dispersion in many
        separate repositories. EML is the first content standard designed
        specifically to address these issues for ecological data. Wide adoption

        such as ASCII or UTF-8, and includes the information needed to parse
        the data stream to extract the entity and its attributes from the

        supported linking across packages, so you could re-use the same
        document in multiple packages. In EML 2.0.0 Release Candidate 1 we
        redesigned the packaging structure to only allow linking within a
        single package. Thus, one could re-use a party description or attribute
        list within a package, but not across several. This is a compromise
        that keeps some reusability but has fewer management problems. Along
        with this change is an ability to put all metadata and data in a single
        document for transport -- while still not limiting ourselves to a
        monolithic structure. This has benefits (akin to db normalization) and
        costs (access control, ownership, and multiple update problems).</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td valign="top" align="left"><a name="id.13"></a><a name="N100E8"></a><b>13. </b></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>How are EML modules linked together?</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td valign="top" align="left"><b></b></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>With "id" attributes and "references" elements
        in each module. Certain modules within EML allow you to
        identify specific sub-trees with a unique identifier (id). This 
        identifier can then be used in place of content in other parts 
        of the EML document by placing it in a "references" element.</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td valign="top" align="left"><b></b></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Our general approach in EML has been to create ComplexTypes (CT)
        when we wanted a particular block to be reusable. This concept was
        extended for linking modules together by adding an optional attribute
        named "id" of type "xs:string" for each ComplexType. This allows us to
        uniquely address each block defined by a CT.
        For the "ResourceBase" CT, this id element replaces the "identifier"
        element and acts as the overall identifier for the package. The content
        model for each CT is a choice between the existing content model and a
        new element named "references" of type "xs:string". This element is
        used to hold a reference to an existing sub-tree identified by its id.
        This relationship between the "references" element and the "id"
        identifiers is enforced by defining a "key" for the "id"
        elements and a "keyref" for the "references" elements. This use of
        a key and keyref differs slightly from the XML Schema case because
        in XML Schema, keys can not be null, whereas we want people to be
        able to optionally omit the "id" attribute.  Consequently, we have
        incorporated the rules about the correspondence between keys and
        keyrefs into the EML specification, but not into the schemas directly.
        Thus, in order to validate that an EML document is valid EML, you must
        use a parser that understands the referencing system in EML and can
        check that it is used correctly.  An example system that handles this
        key validation is shipped with the EML distribution (see the
        "EML Parser").
        
        Here's a fragment of an example xml doc to illustrate:
        <pre class="programlisting">
            ...
            &lt;creator id="id.p1"&gt;
              &lt;individualName&gt;&lt;surName&gt;Jones&lt;/surName&gt;&lt;/individualName&gt;
            &lt;/creator&gt;
            &lt;associatedParty&gt;
              &lt;references&gt;id.p1&lt;/references&gt;

            &lt;/contact&gt;
            ...
        </pre>
        </p><p>This even works for types that extend other types as long as the
        subclass is the one that does the referencing (e.g., associatedParty
        can reference creator, but not vice versa).

        be typical in a MS Access file that contained multiple tables of data).
        However, it is typically used to describe a file or stream that is in
        some text-based format such as ASCII or UTF-8, and includes the
        information needed to parse the data stream to extract the entity and
        its attributes from the stream. There are 3 distribution types, online,
        offline, and inline. To include data in EML you would populate the
        inline element with the data file described in the data format element.
        The data that is in the inline element should conform to the
        description provided by the eml-physical module.
        Binary data files can be included using Base64 encoding.</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td valign="top" align="left"><a name="id.15"></a><a name="N10101"></a><b>15. </b></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>What can I do with my EML structured metadata?</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td valign="top" align="left"><b></b></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p>Tools are currently being developed to allow automated

        hierarchical so where you use different elements is very important. For
        instance, if you use a TemporalCoverage element and reference it to a
        dataset element, you are saying that that entire dataset took place
        during that time. If, instead, you reference it to a dataTable, you
        are saying that only that table was covered by that time period. You
        must gauge exactly what you are trying to describe in the structure

        the two?</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td valign="top" align="left"><b></b></td><td valign="top" align="left"><p> The eml-methods module describes the methods followed
        in the creation of the dataset being described, including
        description of field, laboratory and processing steps,
        sampling methods and units, quality control procedures. The
        eml-methods module is used to describe the "actual" procedures
        that are used in the creation or the subsequent processing of
        a dataset. Likewise, eml-methods is used to describe
        processes that have been used to define / improve the quality
        of a data file, or to identify potential problems with the
        data file. The eml-protocol module is intended to be used to
        document a "prescribed" procedure, whereas the eml-method
        module is used to describe procedures that were actually
        performed. The distinction is that the use of the term
        "protocol" is used in the "prescriptive" sense, and the term
        "method" is used in the "descriptive" sense. This distinction
        allows managers to build a protocol library of well-known,
        established protocols (procedures), but also document what
        procedure was truly performed in relation to the established
        protocol. The method may have diverged from the protocol
        purposefully, or perhaps incidentally, but the procedural
        lineage is still preserved and understandable.
        </p><p>The eml-methods module, like other modules, may be
        referenced via the &lt;references&gt; tag. This allows a method
        to be described once, and then used as a reference in other
        locations within the EML document via it's ID.
