<abstract>
  <para>&quot;1) Objectives: 
a) Quantify “undisturbed” state prior to snow break.
b) Quantify carbon and nitrogen stocks in aboveground CWD as a component of a full carbon and nitrogen budget.  
c) Estimate turnover of CWD carbon depending on species, positioning and mortality 
i) Indirect carbon balance approach: Calculate deadwood input (I) to the forest floor by combining chronosequence data on woody increment and biomass. Calculate turnover  under assumption of equilibrium stocks (M/I)
ii) Direct approach: Revisit site after 2 to 3 years and measure position, take a sample to estimate density and volume loss (The Martin’s have observed a progression from a solid log to something substantially decayed within few months).      
d) Compare species-specific sensitivities to snowbreak as a trait 
i) Calculate the likelihood of being subject to snowbreak given the species, size and potentially the relative position using logistic regression 
ii) Calculate the likelihood of snag survival; this requires re-sampling
iii) Estimate the down-slope transport of deadwood pieces
iv) Estimate the time it takes for deadwood to collapse and touch the forest floor

       <attributeDefinition>Reasearch plots of the Biodiversity - Ecosystem functioning experiment (BEF-China). There are three main sites for research plots in the BEF Experiment: Comparative Study Plots (CSP) in the  Gutianshan Nature Reserve, having a size of 30x30m^2, measured on the ground. Main Experiment plots have a size of 1 mu, which is about 25x25m^2 in horizontal projection. Pilot Study Plots have a size of 1x1 m^2.  
Research plots on the main experiment have a &quot;p&quot; in front of their IDs and then a 6 digit code: Plots in the main sites A and B are named according to their position in the original spreadsheet, in which they were designed.  They consist of 6 digits: _1st digit_: Site (1:A, 2:B), _digit 2and3_: southwards row: as in spreadsheets the rows are named from the top to the bottom; _digit 4 and 5_: westward column: as in the original spreadsheet, but the letters are converted to numbers (A=01, B=02); _6th digit_: indicator, if the plot has been shifted a quarter mu.  Example: &quot;p205260&quot;: &quot;p&quot; means that this is a plot that is specified.  &quot;2&quot; means, that we are at site B.  Now the coordinates of the south - west corner: &quot;0526&quot;.  Since &quot;e&quot; is the fifth letter of the alphabet, this is Plot E26.   The last digit &quot;0&quot; means that this plot was not moved by a quarter of a Mu, as some sites in Site A. The 6th digit can also indicate the subplot within the plot. &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot; indicate the northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest quarter plot respectively.
