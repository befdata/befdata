  description: "\"Sukzession und auch Baumartendiversit\xC3\xA4t (aber nicht H\xC3\xB6henabh\xC3\xA4ngigkeit) wurden als Determinanten f\xC3\xBCr Herbivorie bereits bearbeitet. Der gro\xC3\x9Fe Unterschied zwischen den Baumarten (die Herbivorie variiert in einer Gr\xC3\xB6\xC3\x9Fenordnung von ungef\xC3\xA4hr einer Zehnerpotenz) wird damit aber nur zu einem gewissen Anteil beschrieben (f\xC3\xBCr die hier vorgeschlagene Untersuchung muss dieser Herbivorie-Anteil \xE2\x80\x9Eherausgerechnet\xE2\x80\x9C werden). Deshalb stellt sich die Frage, welche \xE2\x80\x9EEigenschaften\xE2\x80\x9C der Baum- oder Straucharten daf\xC3\xBCr verantwortlich sind, dass Herbivorie so unterschiedlich ist?\n\
    Voruntersuchungen: Als Grundlage hat Andreas erste korrelative Analysen zwischen \xE2\x80\x9Etraits\xE2\x80\x9C (Blatteigenschaften, Daten der Hallenser) der Baumarten und dem Ausma\xC3\x9F der Herbivorie durchgef\xC3\xBChrt. Erstaunlicherweise ergaben sich nur ganz \xE2\x80\x9Eschlechte\xE2\x80\x9C Korrelationen (auch bei C/N-Verh\xC3\xA4ltnissen). (Eine Ausnahme stellt das Verbreitungsgebiet der Baumarten dar. Mit Zunahme des Verbreitungsgebietes steigt auch die Herbivorie der Baumarten.)\n\
    Welche Daten brauchen wir noch? (1) Einige Traits sollten an den jungen B\xC3\xA4umen gemessen werden (z.B. C/N-Verh\xC3\xA4ltnis, Kutikula-Dicke). Die Daten von Martin aus dem Gew\xC3\xA4chshausexperiment k\xC3\xB6nnen evtl. auch in \xC3\x9Cbereinstimmung mit den Daten von den alten Baumindividuen in den CSPs f\xC3\xBCr die Analyse herangezogen werden. In jedem Fall sollte der Datensatz einheitlich sein. (2) Wir ben\xC3\xB6tigen Daten zu \xE2\x80\x9Echemical uniqueness\xE2\x80\x9C, die f\xC3\xBCr andere Gruppen von B\xC3\xA4umen eine gro\xC3\x9Fe Pr\xC3\xA4diktivit\xC3\xA4t der Herbivorie besitzen (u.a. HPLC). (3) Phylogenie kann ebenfalls eine Rolle spielen. \n\
    Wer k\xC3\xB6nnte was machen? Zu (1): A hat bereits begonnen, einige traits von jungen Baumindividuen zu bestimmen. Zu (2): A und T haben bereits mit Wolf Palm (Uni L\xC3\xBCneburg; Spezialist f\xC3\xBCr HPLC, exzellenter Chemiker mit Schwerpunkt in Analytik, auch organischer Stoffe) gesprochen, der seine Mithilfe zugesagt hat. Zusammen mit ihm k\xC3\xB6nnte A Daten zur \xE2\x80\x9Echemical uniqueness\xE2\x80\x9C gewinnen. Zu (3): Abschnitte der cpDNA oder mtDNA werden wahrscheinlich von Walter Durka sequenziert, um die Informationen der Phylogenie zu erhalten und auch anderen subprojects zug\xC3\xA4nglich zu machen. \n\
    Offene Fragen: Wie bekommen wir einen konsistenten Datensatz f\xC3\xBCr junge B\xC3\xA4ume der CSPs zusammen? (Martin hat viele Daten zu traits von jungen B\xC3\xA4umen aus dem Gew\xC3\xA4chshaus. Kann man diese Daten heranziehen?)\""

  description: "Distance between the matrix of adult species in one plot to the matrix of recruitment species in the same plot. This measure can be interpreted as how similar the adult community is to the recruitment community. Three distance measures have so far been used: Bray-Curtis using abundances, Soerensen using presence absence and exclusive species. Abundance of adults was taken from Mastertable5.csv (prepared by Martin B\xC3\xB6hnke, based on the 2008 and 2009 count data in all CSPs). Abundance of recruits was taken from CSP herblayer specieslist_SP11_HB2.xls (prepared by Helge Bruelheide, based on the table from Sabine Both with all species in the herb layer, extracting all woody species). The match between both datasets were done in Excel (Abundance_Frequency7_HB.xls), Formulas: Bray Curtis: '=2*Sum(Min(Abundance_Adults,Abundance_Recruits)/(Sum(Abundance_Adults)+Sum(Abundance_Recruits)); Soerensen: =2*Sum(Min(Presence_Adults,Presence_Recruits)/(Sum(Presence_Adults)+Sum(Presence_Recruits)); exclusive species: =Sum(Presence_Adults)-Sum(Min(Presence_Adults,Presence_Recruits)"

    Soil moisture was assessed on soil samples taken from five different layers of the mineral soil in 10 cm-intervals on three dates (June/July 2008, November 2008, March 2009). Values are gravimetric water contents (%) related to soil dry weight. Soil layers were Sum08: 0-10, 10-20, 20-30,30-40, 40-50 cm
    Aut08 + Spr09: 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50 cm. Mean values per plot were obtained by averaging the soil water contents over all layers and all dates. All calculations are based on SoilMoisture_HB.xls, provided by Stefan Trogisch.

  description: "Basal area was summed up separately for living and snowbreak effected stems, for large stems and smal stems from the center plot. Standard deviations are based on the MCMC chains generated for the missing dbh values. If all values were given, there is no error. We used a non-linear function (dbh = a + bd^c) to estimate dbh from basal diameter, based on available values from the census of alive stems and dead stems. We additionally allowed for increasing variance. The values given here represent the mean of the posterior distribution of the estimated values and the standard deviation. We used the following model to estimate dbh from basal diameter in cases dbh was missing:    dbh[i] ~ dnorm(mu_dbh[i], tau_dbh[i]);         mu_dbh[i] <- a + pow(bd[i], c);  tau_dbh[i] <- pow(sigma_dbh[i], -2);       sigma_dbh[i] <- d + e * bd[i]. Estimated parameters were: a = -0.46 +- 0.04 sd; c =  0.93 +- 0.004 sd; d = 0.09 +- 0.04 sd; e = 0.12 +- 0.01 sd."
