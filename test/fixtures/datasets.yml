  title: Comparative study plot information to be shared with all BEF-China scientists,
    with more problems
  abstract: This research is designed to collect data on diversity in subtropical
    forest ecosystems and relate it to ecosystem services such as primary productivity,
    carbon storage, prevention of soil erosion, and invasion resistance to exotic
    plants. This data describes the Comparative Study Sites (CSPs), used to compare
    the planted diversity experiment with naturally grown forests. The plots have
    a size of 30x30m and are situated in the Gutianshan Nature reserve, Zhejiang Province,
    China. Data were collected in 2008. They comprise geographical locations, elevation,
    inclination, exposition of the plots, an estimated age of the plot, height and
    cover of two tree layers, the shrub layer and the herb layer, and cover of bare
    soil. This data set includes environmental measures on the CSPs that are of interest
    for all researchers. It additionally includes important aggregated data as for
    example diversity measures of tree, shrub and herb layer.

  spatialextent: ! "The Gutianshan National Nature Reserve (NNR) is located in the
    western part of Zhejiang Province (29º8'18\" -  29º17'29\" N, 118º2'14\"
    - 118º11'12\" E, Fig. 1).  The Gutianshan NNR has an area of approximately
    81 km2 and was initially established as a National Forest Reserve in 1975 and
    became a National Nature Reserve in 2001. The NNR comprises a large portion of
    broad-leaved forests of advanced successional stages (Hu & Yu 2008), which have
    not been managed since the beginning of the 1990ies, as well as young successional
    stages and conifer plantations, mainly of Cunninghamia lanceolata and Pinus massoniana.
    --- The vegetation is composed of different types of subtropical evergreen and
    mixed broad-leaved forests (Yu et al. 2001). Most of the stands are secondary
    forests, evidenced by maximum tree ages of 180 years, by agricultural terraces
    in almost all plots and by the presence of charcoal in almost all soil profiles.
    Around the Gutianshan NRR extensive deforestation has occurred during the Great
    Leap Forward in the 1950s, as in most parts of Southeast China. However, due to
    prevailing steep slopes, the Gutianshan area was only marginally usable for agricultural
    activities, and thus an exceptionally intact forest cover has been preserved.
    --- The climate at Gutianshan NNR is warm and temperate with a short dry season
    in November and December and with warm summers (Fig. 2). The climatic conditions
    are characteristic for the subtropics with an annual average temperature of 15.1°C,
    January minimum temperatures of -6.8°C, July maximum temperatures of 38.1°C
    and an accumulated temperature sum (> 5°C) of 5221.5 degree days."
  temporalextent: Most of the data were collected in 2008, while some additional data
    were also collected in 2009.
  taxonomicextent: ! 'The forest is representative for Chinese mixed broad-leaved
    forests (Wu 1980, Hu & Yu 2008, Legendre et al. 2009), with evergreen species
    dominating the forest in number of individuals (Yu et al. 2001) but with approximately
    similar proportions of deciduous species in terms of species number (Lou and Jin
    2000). A total of 1426 seed plant species of 648 genera and of 149 families has
    been recorded as occurring naturally in the NNR. About 258 of the species are
    woody (Lou and Jin 2000). '
  design: ! "The utilization of the forest until the 1990ies allowed us to employ
    a stratified sampling for establishing observational plots (in the following called
    Comparative Study Plots, CSPs) according to successional stages. Although most
    of the forest are belongs to intermediate or late successional stages, young stands
    are located in the peripheral buffer zone of the Gutianshan NNR, where logging
    has been performed until the present. Plots were assigned to five strata according
    to the average age of tree layer individuals (1: < 20 yrs, 2: < 40 yrs, 3: < 60
    yrs, 4: < 80 yrs, 5: > 80 yrs). CSP locations within strata were selected
    randomly; however, due to inaccessibility and excessive slopes (> 50°) of many
    locations, parts to the NNR had to be excluded from sampling, thus, resulting
    in an uneven distribution of some of the plots (Fig. 1). In total, 27 CSPs were
    established between May and July 2008. Species recording was performed between
    May and October 2008 with several visits per plot. Each CSP has a size of 30 m
    by 30 m, which approximates to the plot size (1 mu plot) in the BEF-Experiment
    at Xingangshan (Jiangxi, Fig. 1). The corners of every CSP were permanently marked
    with magnets and subareas of each CSP were set apart for measuring various ecosystem
    functioning variables, among them basic soil properties. Soil moisture was assessed
    on soil samples taken from five different layers of the mineral soil in 10 cm-intervals
    on three dates (summer and autumn 2008, spring 2009). We used mean values by averaging
    the soil water contents over all layers and all dates. Topsoil samples (0-5 cm)
    were taken in summer 2009 from four locations in each plot, pooled in a bulk sample
    per CSP, air-dried and then used to determine pH, both measured in H2O and 1 M
    KCl. A complete inventory of woody species and bamboo (Pleioblastus amarus) (>
    1 m height) was carried out on the whole plot. All herbaceous species and tree
    recruits (i.e. seedlings and saplings â\x89¤ 1 m height) were recorded in a central
    subplot of 10 m x 10 m. All individuals were identified to the species level,
    making use of herbarium samples and comparisons with correctly identified individuals,
    and counted per species. The proportion of unidentifiable individuals in a CSP
    ranged between 0 % and 2.3 %. These individuals were not included in the subsequent
    data analysis."

  comment: Mind that there are several other separate data sets, which contain more
    recent data, regarding successional stage, soil properties.  The most important
    data from this data set are the vegetation layer characteristics as well as the
    data on diversity and dimilarity of tree layer trees and recruitment trees.
  dataanalysis: ! "To analyze the floristic composition of all woody species we employed
    non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using counts of individuals per CSP
    and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. The statistics were computed with R (2008), using
    the vegan package (Dixon 2003, Oksanen et al. 2006). Rare species were not removed,
    thus all 148 species of adult trees and shrubs entered the analysis. Wisconsin
    double standardization was applied to square root transformed abundance data.
    Default options were used for scaling, so that one unit means halving of community
    similarity from replicate similarity. Centring of the origin to the average of
    the axes was performed and the plot was configured in a way to maximize the variance
    of points on the first dimension. Species scores were added to the final solution
    as weighted averages. In a subsequent multiple regression, the NMDS plot scores
    on axes 1 and 2 were related to two sets of variables describing plot characteristics
    (elevation, aspect, inclination, geographical coordinates, height and cover of
    the different layers, coverage of bare ground, soil moisture as well as assignment
    to the five successional stages as described above) and species richness (number
    of woody species [height > 1 m] in the 900 m2-plot as well as number of herb species,
    woody recruit species [seedlings, saplings], woody climber species and herb climber
    species in the 100 m2-subplot [only recorded if height â\x89¤ 1 m]). The significance
    of the correlations was assessed using permutation tests (n=999) and r2 is given
    as goodness of fit. Thus, structure and richness variables were treated as independent
    from the floristic composition and tested for relationships with the species composition
    in the CSPs. A detrended correspondence analysis was performed to determine the
    gradient lengths and to yield an estimate of Î²-diversity (Jongman et                         al.
    1995). --- All ordinary linear regressions were calculated with R (2008). Multiple
    regressions were used to test the dependence of species richness of adult trees
    and shrubs (individuals > 1 m height), on the one hand, on all variables describing
    plot characteristics and structure, and on the other hand, on variables related
    to species diversity (for a list of variables see Table 1). The input variables
    were standardized (i.e. z transformed) prior to analysis, resulting in a model
    with intercept = 0. Model fitting started with a full set of independent variables
    and was optimized using backward selection. Predictors were eliminated one by
    one from the model based on their F statistics until all the remaining variables
    were significant at the ï\x81¡ = 0.05 level. Partial correlation coefficients
    were calculated using type II sums of squares (SS), as SS/(SS+SSE), where SSE
    is the error sum of squares. The partial r2 gives the fraction of variance explained
    for each variable after the effect of all other variables in the model has been
    accounted for. Multiple regression analyses were performed with the SAS 9.1 package
    (proc reg, SAS Institute 2002). --- Rarefaction analysis was based on Hurlbertâ\x80\x99s
    (1971) formula, as implemented in the vegan package in R, using a fixed number
    of 100 individuals per plot. Rarity was assessed by ranking all species both in
    the group of adult trees and shrubs as well as in the group of seedlings and saplings
    in the order of their abundance across all plots. Species were considered â\x80\x9Crareâ\x80\x9D
    or â\x80\x9Ccommonâ\x80\x9D when they occurred in the lower or upper half of all
    ranks, respectively. --- To relate the number of recruits to the number of adults,
    the census from the central 10 m x 10 m subplot was extrapolated to the whole
    plot are by multiplying all counts of recruits by 9. As Wright (2002) pointed
    out the speciesâ\x80\x99 per capita recruitment rate cannot be plotted against
    the speciesâ\x80\x99 abundance, as this takes the form of y/x versus x. Thus,
    we directly regressed the number of recruits on the number of adult plants and
    tested for a log-log relationship after transforming both the count data of adults
    and recruits by log10(x+1). We then compared the observed and expected slope and
    identified outliers from this prediction by plotting confidence intervals using
    a tolerance of Â± two standard deviations. --- For each species, per capita recruitment
    rates were calculated by relating the number of recruits (multiplied with 9 as
    explained above) to the number of adult trees and shrubs. This was done on three
    levels, on the level of each plot, across all plots of one successional stage
    and for all 27 plots of the whole study. Plot-wise per capita recruitment rate
    was obtained by averaging the per capita recruitment rate of all species present
    in a plot. Using a mixed model with successional stage as fixed factor and species
    identity as random factor, we tested for the impact of successional stage on per
    capita recruitment rate (proc mixed, SAS 9.2). --- Species similarity between
    adults and recruits was calculated for each plot, both based on counts of individuals
    using Bray-Curtis similarity and on presence/absence using the SÃ¸rensen index
    (SÃ¸rensen 1948). In addition, we counted those species among the recruits that
    were not yet present in a plot among the adults (i.e. species in a plot exclusively
    found in the group of recruits, not among the adults)."
