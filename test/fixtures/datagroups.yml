  description: ! 'Reasearch plots of the Biodiversity - Ecosystem functioning experiment
    (BEF-China). There are three main sites for research plots in the BEF Experiment:
    Comparative Study Plots (CSP) in the  Gutianshan Nature Reserve, having a size
    of 30x30m^2, measured on the ground. Main Experiment plots have a size of 1 mu,
    which is about 25x25m^2 in horizontal projection. Pilot Study Plots have a size
    of 1x1 m^2.'

  description: ! 'The stems were marked with a metal tag with a code compound of a
    number of six positions. The tag was attached to each individual by attaching
    it with a wire sorrounding one stem, taking care to leave it long enough to allow
    the grow of the stem. Normally the wire was attached between 1 and 1.8m over the
    ground. If the individual had many stems, such as often seen in shrubs, only one
    of the stems was tagged. '
