  title: Metal Tag Numbers in the CSPs
  updated_at: 2011-03-28 13:59:35.414400 Z
  instrumentation: letters are attached if the same number was used for different tree individuals. This occurred a few times. Numbers are unique only within CSPs
  id: 4
  timelatency: 30.0
  description: "The stems were marked with a metal tag with a code compound of a number of six positions. The tag was attached to each individual by attaching it with a wire sorrounding one stem, taking care to leave it long enough to allow the grow of the stem. Normally the wire was attached between 1 and 1.8m over the ground. If the individual had many stems, such as often seen in shrubs, only one of the stems was tagged. "
