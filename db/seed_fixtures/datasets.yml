  title: How to fill a BEFdata Workbook
  abstract: The BEFdata portal allows to import research data directly from an Excel
    2003 workbook. To get most out of the workbook, it's good to know that the "General
    Metadata" sheet saves dataset ownership, as well as general information of where,
    how, and why data was sampled. The data can belong to a project and will then
    be displayed on this project's data set list. It can belong to members of the
    portal, then these will be asked if someone requests this file for analysis.
  usagerights: Here you can specify the intended usage. But during upload you still
    have the choice to open the dataset to members of the project, members of the
    portal, or to the public.
  spatialextent: This is for the location where all the data comes from.
  temporalextent: Often, date is not provided in the data itself. So here you can
    describe when the data was derived. This applies to analysis performed with your
    data. So individual height of a tree will change from year to year, so it is good
    to know, when the measurement was taken.
  taxonomicextent: You can list your organism taxa or state that no organisms were
    used. You can also specify the column in raw data where the organisms are named.
  design: Describe, what was the design of your campaign. How many objects in what
    groups did you sample? Did you sample along gradients like diversity or successional
    age? Did you place your samples randomly, selected trees at random or in a stratified
    random design?
  circumstances: Are there circumstances that explain the precision of your measurements?
    Could it be that a sandstorm destroyed part of the plots in a given year?

  comment: Comments on the file will be displayed to the owners, to the administrators,
    and to members of the Project board. You will then see the comments alongside
    the title in each list displaying the title of the data set.
  dataanalysis: Here you can tell the reader, which columns were the response and
    which columns in the raw data were explanatory variables. You can also indicate,
    what the main response means in term of ecosystem functioning. The main response
    column may be the abundance of tree species, the size of trees derived from dbh
    and height, or the kinetic energy of raindrops passing through forest canopy.
