  title: Data group
  description: The Data Group allows to link different data columns to one group.
    This means that data between files and within files can be linked. If the data
    type specified is "category", every entry in the datacolumn will be validated
    against a list of names specific to this data group. If the data type specified
    is "text", the entry will not be validated but saved as is. All the other data
    types are validated according to rules. Numbers are checked if they can be converted
    to numbers. If not, they will be treated as categories. Same for date entries.
    This allows to specify different missing value types. If you have a number column  for
    the data group "altitude", you can specify that "-9999" means that this point
    is outside the range, while "NA" means, that it was not measured.
